# Secured-Audio-Signal-and-Voice-Message-Transmission-Using-Hybrid-Algorithm
●	An audio file of .wav format is taken and then using hybrid algorithm (block cipher algorithm) is used for encryption. The audio file, an 8 bit .wav file is taken and converted to its numeric equivalent for it to be encrypted.

●	For encrypting the audio file, it is converted into its numpy array equivalent by using the scipy library and then this array of data is encrypted using combination of this algorithm. The encrypted file is then decrypted back by removing the noise added in the first place.

●	The file used is a .wav file. Waveform audio file format was developed by Microsoft and IBM and is the main audio format used over the windows operating system. 

●	The bitstream encoding is the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) format. The file encrypted is an 8 bit audio file.

●	For Voice message/data we will use python speechrecognition and pyaudio modules.

●	Speech to text translation: This is done with the help of Google Speech Recognition. This requires an active internet connection to work.
